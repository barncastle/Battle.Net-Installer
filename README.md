#### Error Messages and Codes

Since this tool interacts directly with the Battle.net agent there are no human-readable errors just error codes. This tool does it's best to indicate the potential problem and displays the full exception when it occurs. Additional details can be found in the agent log files which are located within the `%programdata%\Battle.net\Agent\Agent.xxxx` directories.

 Some known and common errors can be found below:

- "Unable to find Agent.exe", the Battle.net app is not installed on your system.
- "Unable to start Agent.exe", the app cannot start the Battle.net agent as Battle.net is either missing or not setup. 
- "Unable to authenticate", the Battle.net app is not signed in to and therefore cannot install games.
- "Unable to install", your computer doesn't meet the minimum specs and/or space requirements.
- "2221", the supplied TACT Product is unavailable or invalid.
- "2421", your computer doesn't meet the minimum specs and/or space requirements.
